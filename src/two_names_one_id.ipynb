In the case of Wolfgang Plischke, there is an additional \"Professor\" title added to his name for his second and third role held at Bayer AG from 2006 to 2014 and 2016 to 2021. Some quick research shows that this is because he started working as an honorary professor at university in 2011. The record for his ongoing position at the time was changed to reflect the update.
